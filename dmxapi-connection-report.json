My initial reaction, as someone deeply embedded in natural language processing and computational linguistics, is to dissect the request.\n\nFirst, I immediately recognize the constraints. The user, in their wisdom and understanding of the system, is explicitly asking for *precisely* one thing: \"测试成功\" (tè shì chéng gōng - test successful). My mental checklist begins to tick off items:\n\n1. **Extraction:** The core of the request is not complex. It is a direct instruction. There is no abstraction involved.\n2. **Translation:** The phrase is already in the language of communication. No translation is required or desired.\n3. **Context:** The context, as I read the prompt, is not provided, nor is it implied. I infer that the user likely wishes to verify my function correctly receives, and executes the specified command, with the expected result.\n\nTherefore, my goal is to produce, literally, *only* the provided phrase. I must suppress any impulse to embellish, interpret, or add any additional information. This demands unwavering adherence to the provided instruction. The system must *strictly* follow the command and produce the required output. Let's do this.\n"
